### 🚧 v13.0 — Research & Documentation Foundation (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Ground the next feature milestone in solid research while closing documentation and quick-reference gaps left by v12.0. Two research design docs (swarming architecture, organisational SSO) and two documentation deliverables (docs site refresh, quick-reference files).

- [x] **Phase 57: Research — Parallel Job Swarming** — Design doc covering use case analysis, pull-model impact, and complexity/value recommendation for fan-out swarming (completed 2026-03-24)
- [ ] **Phase 58: Research — Organisational SSO** — Design doc covering protocol choice, JWT bridge, RBAC mapping, CF Access integration, air-gap isolation, and 2FA policy
- [ ] **Phase 59: Documentation** — `.env.example`, Docker deployment section, docs/wiki branding alignment with dashboard, v12.0 feature updates across existing docs
- [ ] **Phase 60: Quick Reference** — Move HTML files to `quick-ref/`, rebrand to Axiom, update operator guide and course for v12.0 and current architecture

## Phase Details

### Phase 57: Research — Parallel Job Swarming
**Goal**: A complete design document exists that lets the team make an informed build/defer decision on parallel job swarming
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase of milestone)
**Requirements**: SWRM-01, SWRM-02, SWRM-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. The design doc articulates a concrete use case analysis — when fan-out/campaigns are sufficient versus when genuine swarming is needed
  2. The design doc covers pull-model impact: what breaks at scale, how backpressure would be handled, and how ordering/barrier synchronisation would work
  3. The design doc delivers a clear complexity/value trade-off recommendation with explicit next-step guidance (build now, defer, or needs further spike)
  4. A reader with no prior context on swarming can understand the proposal and the reasoning behind the recommendation
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [ ] 57-01-PLAN.md — Verify and finalise the swarming design document; human sign-off on all three requirements

### Phase 58: Research — Organisational SSO
**Goal**: A complete design document exists that lets the team implement SSO in a future milestone without re-doing protocol or architecture choices
**Depends on**: Nothing (parallel with Phase 57)
**Requirements**: SSO-01, SSO-02, SSO-03, SSO-04, SSO-05, SSO-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. OIDC vs SAML recommendation is documented with rationale scoped to non-air-gapped EE deployments
  2. The JWT bridge exchange flow is specified — including how `token_version` interactions and SSO session invalidation work
  3. IdP group-to-MoP-role mapping is designed, including the default role assigned on first SSO login
  4. Cloudflare Access integration pattern is documented with explicit security implications of trusting the `Cf-Access-Jwt-Assertion` header
  5. Air-gap isolation strategy is documented — SSO must be a feature-flagged/plugin addition with zero impact on offline CE deployments
  6. TOTP 2FA interaction policy is defined — what happens when SSO auth is used alongside MoP TOTP step-up requirements
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 59: Documentation
**Goal**: The docs site accurately reflects the v12.0 feature set, is visually consistent with the dashboard, and new operators have everything they need to run Axiom with Docker
**Depends on**: Nothing (parallel with Phases 57–58)
**Requirements**: DOCS-01, DOCS-02, DOCS-03, DOCS-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A new operator can find every required and optional environment variable in one place via `.env.example` with descriptions
  2. The docs site has a "Running with Docker" deployment section covering env var requirements end-to-end
  3. The docs site visual identity (colours, fonts, logo) matches the dashboard — no jarring brand mismatch between the two surfaces
  4. Existing docs reflect v12.0 changes: unified `script` task type, guided form, DRAFT lifecycle, bulk ops, Queue view, Scheduling Health, retention config, and UI label renames are all described accurately
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 60: Quick Reference
**Goal**: Quick-reference HTML files are findable, branded correctly, and cover the current Axiom v12.0 feature set
**Depends on**: Nothing (parallel with Phases 57–59)
**Requirements**: QREF-01, QREF-02, QREF-03, QREF-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Both HTML files live under `quick-ref/` — the project root no longer contains loose HTML files
  2. All "Master of Puppets" references in the course file are replaced with "Axiom"
  3. The operator guide covers v12.0 additions: new views (Queue, Scheduling Health), all three task type runtimes, guided vs Advanced dispatch modes, and DRAINING node state
  4. The course content reflects current architecture and tooling — no references to removed or renamed concepts (e.g. `python_script` task type, old UI labels)
**Plans**: TBD
