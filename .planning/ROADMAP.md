</details>

### 🚧 v14.1 — First-User Readiness (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Close all open product BLOCKERs from the v14.0 cold-start friction report. A first-time user following only the published docs can install Axiom, enroll a node, and dispatch a signed job to completion — on both CE and EE.

- [x] **Phase 66: Backend Code Fixes** — Verify and complete all node image and compose fixes; CE-gate all execution routes via EE stub (CODE-01 through CODE-04) (completed 2026-03-25)
- [x] **Phase 67: Getting-Started Documentation** — Rewrite install.md, enroll-node.md, and first-job.md with correct commands, CLI alternatives, signing prerequisites, and tab support (DOCS-01 through DOCS-11) (completed 2026-03-26)
- [x] **Phase 68: EE Documentation** — Correct EE getting-started endpoint references and resolve AXIOM_LICENCE_KEY naming inconsistency (EEDOC-01 through EEDOC-02) (completed 2026-03-26)

## Phase Details

### Phase 66: Backend Code Fixes
**Goal**: The node image builds correctly on all platforms, the DinD compose stack runs jobs without path errors, and the CE/EE API boundary for Execution History is enforced in code
**Depends on**: Phase 65 (v14.0 complete)
**Requirements**: CODE-01, CODE-02, CODE-03, CODE-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A freshly-built node image contains a working Docker CLI binary (`docker --version` succeeds inside the container)
  2. A job dispatched to a node in the cold-start compose stack reaches COMPLETED — the `/tmp` bind mount allows script delivery to the Docker socket
  3. PowerShell is present and executable in the built node image (`pwsh --version` succeeds); the build does not fail silently on arm64 hosts due to a missing platform guard
  4. `GET /api/executions` returns HTTP 402 in CE mode; `test_ce_smoke.py` confirms all 7 execution-related routes are CE-gated
**Plans**: 3 plans
Plans:
- [ ] 66-01-PLAN.md — Containerfile.node arm64 platform guard (CODE-03)
- [ ] 66-02-PLAN.md — CE execution stub router, EE router, test updates (CODE-04)
- [ ] 66-03-PLAN.md — Image build verification and full test suite gate (CODE-01, CODE-02, CODE-03)

### Phase 67: Getting-Started Documentation
**Goal**: A first-time user with no prior Axiom knowledge can follow install.md → enroll-node.md → first-job.md from a fresh machine and reach a dispatched, signed, COMPLETED job using either the dashboard or CLI — with zero undocumented prerequisites
**Depends on**: Phase 66
**Requirements**: DOCS-01, DOCS-02, DOCS-03, DOCS-04, DOCS-05, DOCS-06, DOCS-07, DOCS-08, DOCS-09, DOCS-10, DOCS-11
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A user following install.md knows exactly what value to set for `ADMIN_PASSWORD` and where to set it before running `docker compose up`; an EE section covers `AXIOM_LICENCE_KEY` injection and the docs reference a pre-built tarball for users without GitHub access
  2. A user following enroll-node.md can generate a JOIN_TOKEN via a curl command (no browser required); the Option B compose snippet uses the correct Axiom node image, `EXECUTION_MODE=docker`, a Docker socket mount note, and `https://agent:8001` as the AGENT_URL for the cold-start compose scenario
  3. A user following first-job.md encounters Ed25519 signing key setup as a numbered prerequisite before any dispatch step, with a visually prominent callout before the first dispatch attempt
  4. A user following first-job.md can dispatch a signed job via curl (`POST /jobs` with base64 signature) as a documented CLI alternative to the guided dashboard form
  5. `mkdocs build --strict` passes after all doc edits; tab syntax renders correctly across all rewritten pages
**Plans**: 3 plans
Plans:
- [ ] 67-01-PLAN.md — mkdocs.yml tab extension + install.md Git Clone/GHCR Pull tab pair + Server/Cold-Start install tab pair (DOCS-01, DOCS-02, DOCS-08)
- [ ] 67-02-PLAN.md — enroll-node.md CLI token tab, AGENT_URL table restructure, Option A/B tab pair (DOCS-03, DOCS-04, DOCS-05, DOCS-06, DOCS-07)
- [ ] 67-03-PLAN.md — first-job.md pre-dispatch danger callout + Dashboard/CLI dispatch tab pair + full phase verification (DOCS-09, DOCS-10, DOCS-11)

### Phase 68: EE Documentation
**Goal**: EE getting-started and licensing pages accurately reflect the current API surface and use consistent environment variable naming throughout
**Depends on**: Phase 67
**Requirements**: EEDOC-01, EEDOC-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. No reference to `/api/admin/features` appears anywhere in the EE getting-started pages; every reference uses the correct `/api/features` endpoint
  2. `AXIOM_EE_LICENCE_KEY` does not appear in `licensing.md`; all references use `AXIOM_LICENCE_KEY` consistently
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [ ] 68-01-PLAN.md — install.md EE expansion + licensing.md features append + mkdocs --strict gate

### Phase 69: Fix CI release pipeline version pinning and semver tags

**Goal:** Fix the two independent CI failures so that pushing a git tag produces a successful TestPyPI upload (unique version via setuptools-scm) and a correctly-tagged Docker image (type=ref,event=tag replacing broken semver patterns)
**Requirements**: CI-01, CI-02
**Depends on:** Phase 68
**Plans:** 1/1 plans complete

Plans:
- [ ] 69-01-PLAN.md — pyproject.toml setuptools-scm dynamic version + release.yml fetch-depth and Docker metadata tags fix (CI-01, CI-02)

### Phase 70: Fix Getting-Started Doc Regressions
**Goal:** A user following either the CLI or Cold-Start paths in the getting-started guides can successfully enroll a node and install Axiom — the CLI token extraction returns the correct field and the Cold-Start compose commands are present in Steps 3–4 of install.md
**Requirements:** DOCS-01, DOCS-03, DOCS-08
**Depends on:** Phase 69
**Gap Closure:** Closes integration gaps MISS-01 and FLOW-01 from v14.1 audit

Plans:
- [ ] 70-01-PLAN.md — Fix token field + cold-start install steps + mkdocs strict gate (DOCS-01, DOCS-03, DOCS-08)
