## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions

- [v19.0 Roadmap]: DB schema + CRUD completeness combined in Phase 107 -- schema changes unblock everything, CRUD is low complexity and independent
- [v19.0 Roadmap]: Transitive dep resolution (Phase 108) precedes all mirror expansion -- every new mirror backend inherits the correct architecture
- [v19.0 Roadmap]: APT/apk before npm/NuGet/Conda -- dominant Linux air-gap use case first
- [v19.0 Roadmap]: Compose profile separation established in Phase 109, inherited by all subsequent sidecar phases
- [v19.0 Roadmap]: Script Analyzer (Phase 113) is self-contained and deferred until core pipeline is solid
- [v19.0 Roadmap]: Role-based view (UX-06) in Phase 115 depends on Starter Templates (UX-03) and Template catalog (UX-07) existing first

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- BaGetter API key auth flow for `nuget push` in throwaway container needs spike validation before Phase 111 planning
- pypiserver subdirectory serving for dual manylinux/musllinux layout needs confirmation during Phase 108 planning
